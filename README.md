---

## üìå Project Description

**VisionSentinel: Real-Time AI Detection, Segmentation & Captioning with RF-DETR and BLIP** is a high-performance AI framework designed to analyze videos and images in **real-time**, combining **state-of-the-art object detection, instance segmentation, and contextual captioning**.

This project performs advanced basketball video analysis using AI techniques:

* **Player Segmentation** ‚Äì Detects and segments basketball players from the video.
* **Ball Detection** ‚Äì Identifies the basketball in the video.
* **Team Identification** ‚Äì Differentiates between two teams.
* **Court Segmentation** ‚Äì Highlights different areas of the court.
* **Video Captioning** ‚Äì Generates textual descriptions of key scenes automatically using BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining).

**Technologies Used:**

* **RF-DETR** ‚Äì Real-time object segmentation for players, ball, and court areas.
* **Supervision Library** ‚Äì For mask and label annotation.
* **BLIP (Salesforce)** ‚Äì Automatic video/image captioning.
* **OpenCV & PIL** ‚Äì Video and image processing.
* **Python & PyTorch** ‚Äì Core programming and deep learning framework.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time multi-object detection for players and ball.
* Pixel-perfect segmentation of teams and court areas.
* Contextual captions describing video actions and events.
* Fully annotated video output with segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and textual overlays.
* Video summarization with readable textual descriptions.
* Optimized for GPU acceleration and batch processing.

## üöÄ Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Object Detection & Segmentation

* Uses `rfdetr-seg-preview` for high-speed, pixel-accurate instance segmentation.
* Annotates frames/images with advanced masks and labels.

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETRBase
import supervision as sv
from PIL import Image

model = RFDETRBase(model_id="rfdetr-seg-preview")
model.optimize_for_inference()

image = Image.open("frame.jpg")
detections = model.predict(image, threshold=0.5)

annotated_image = sv.MaskAnnotator().annotate(image.copy(), detections)
annotated_image = sv.LabelAnnotator().annotate(annotated_image, detections)
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Contextual Video/Image Captioning with BLIP

* Generates descriptive captions and overlays them on video frames.

```python
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
import torch
from PIL import Image

processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base").eval()
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model.to(device)

image = Image.open("frame.jpg")
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
out_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
caption = processor.decode(out_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Caption:", caption)
```

## ‚ö° Advanced Features

* Real-time multi-object detection with **RF-DETR Seg (Preview)**.
* Pixel-perfect instance segmentation optimized for dynamic scenes.
* Contextual caption generation using BLIP for per-frame insight.
* Fully annotated outputs with bounding boxes, masks, and textual context.
* High-speed inference optimized for GPU and batch processing.
